---

### 🔗 Relationships (summary)
- **User → Property**: One user (host) can own many properties (`Users.id` → `Properties.owner_id`).  
- **Property → Booking**: One property can have many bookings (`Properties.id` → `Bookings.property_id`).  
- **User → Booking**: One user can make many bookings (`Users.id` → `Bookings.user_id`).  
- **Booking → Payment**: One booking can have one or more payments (deposit, final payment) (`Bookings.id` → `Payments.booking_id`).  
- **Property → Review**: One property can have many reviews; a user can review many properties (`Properties.id` → `Reviews.property_id`, `Users.id` → `Reviews.user_id`).

---

### 🧭 Design considerations & optimizations
- **Indexes:** Add indexes on frequently queried columns such as `Properties.location`, `Properties.price_per_night`, `Bookings.property_id`, and `Bookings.user_id`.  
- **Unique constraints:** Enforce uniqueness on `Users.email` and `Users.username`.  
- **Transactions:** Use database transactions for booking + payment flows to maintain consistency (e.g., reserve availability and process payment atomically).  
- **Archiving & partitions:** Consider partitioning booking records by date for very large datasets and archiving old records to improve query performance.  
- **Caching:** Use Redis to cache common reads (e.g., frequently viewed property listings) and to store session data or rate-limiting counters.

- ## 🚀 Feature Breakdown

### 1. User Management
Allow users to register, authenticate, and manage profiles.  
This feature includes secure sign-up/sign-in flows, profile editing, password recovery, and role-based permissions (guest vs host). Proper validation and secure password storage (hashing) are essential to protect user data.

### 2. Property Management
Enable hosts to create, update, and delete property listings with photos and details.  
Hosts can manage availability calendars, pricing, and amenities; users can browse property details and view image galleries.

### 3. Booking System
Provide a booking flow where guests can select dates, check availability, and reserve properties.  
Bookings should support status transitions (pending → confirmed → completed/cancelled), availability checks, and transactional consistency between bookings and payments.

### 4. Payment Processing
Handle payment transactions securely via a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe).  
This includes initiating payments, recording transaction details, and handling success/failure callbacks; sensitive payment data should never be stored in plaintext on the server.

### 5. Review & Rating System
Allow guests to leave ratings and written reviews for properties they stayed in.  
Reviews help future guests make decisions and allow hosts to improve; moderation and anti-abuse checks help maintain trustworthiness.

### 6. Search & Filtering
Provide fast search and filtering (location, price range, dates, guest count, amenities, rating).  
Good search UX combined with efficient backend querying and caching improves discoverability and reduces load on the database.

### 7. Notifications
Send email (or in-app) notifications for booking confirmations, payment receipts, and host messages.  
Asynchronous workers (e.g., Celery) should handle notification delivery to avoid blocking API responses.

### 8. Admin Dashboard
Provide administrative tools to manage users, properties, bookings, payments, and reported content.  
Admins can view metrics, moderate listings/reviews, and manage refund or dispute workflows.

### 9. Reporting & Analytics
Collect and present usage data such as bookings per period, revenue, and popular locations.  
This helps stakeholders make data-driven decisions and identify trends or issues in the platform.

## 🔐 API Security

Security is a critical part of the Airbnb Clone backend to ensure user data and transactions are always protected.

### 🧩 Authentication
Only registered users should access protected endpoints.  
We implement **JWT (JSON Web Token)** authentication to verify user identity on each request. This ensures only valid, logged-in users can perform sensitive actions like creating bookings or payments.

### 🛡️ Authorization
Determines what actions users can perform.  
For example, a host can manage their own listings, but not others; guests can book properties, but not edit them. Proper role-based access control (RBAC) ensures users only access what’s relevant to their role.

### ⚙️ Data Encryption
Sensitive data such as passwords and payment information is encrypted.  
Passwords are hashed using algorithms like **bcrypt**, and all communications occur over **HTTPS** to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

### 🧱 Input Validation & Sanitization
All user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent **SQL Injection** and **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**.  
Framework features and libraries like Django’s ORM automatically handle most query sanitization, but extra validation helps ensure safety.

### 🚦 Rate Limiting
APIs use rate limiting to prevent abuse or brute-force attacks by restricting how often users can make requests in a given time.

### 📊 Logging & Monitoring
Security logs track suspicious activities such as failed login attempts, unauthorized API calls, or unusual payment activity.  
This helps in auditing and responding quickly to incidents.

### 💳 Payment Security
Payments are handled through a trusted third-party provider (e.g., Stripe or PayPal).  
This ensures that no sensitive card data is stored or processed directly on our servers, complying with **PCI-DSS** standards.

---

### 🧠 Importance of Security
- **Protects User Data:** Prevents identity theft and data leaks.  
- **Maintains Trust:** Users are confident that their transactions and personal info are safe.  
- **Ensures Compliance:** Meets industry standards for privacy and financial regulations.  
- **Prevents Downtime:** Protects from denial-of-service attacks and unauthorized intrusions.

- ## ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline

### 🚀 What is CI/CD?
CI/CD stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment** — a development practice that automates code testing, integration, and delivery. It ensures that every code change is automatically built, tested, and deployed, reducing manual work and errors.

### 🔄 Continuous Integration (CI)
In CI, developers frequently push their changes to the main branch.  
Automated tests run immediately to detect bugs early, improving collaboration and ensuring consistent quality.

### 📦 Continuous Deployment (CD)
Once the code passes all tests, it is automatically deployed to staging or production environments.  
This ensures fast feature delivery and reduces downtime between updates.

### 🧰 Tools Used
- **GitHub Actions:** Automates workflows such as running tests, building Docker images, and deploying updates.  
- **Docker:** Ensures consistent environments by packaging the application with all its dependencies.  
- **Heroku / AWS / Render:** Can be used for hosting and automated deployment.  
- **Celery & Redis:** Handle background task management during deployment processes.

### 🧠 Why CI/CD Matters
- Reduces human error during deployment.  
- Enables faster and more reliable software releases.  
- Encourages collaboration and transparency in development.  
- Improves software quality and stability.  
- Allows early detection of bugs through automated testing.

✅ **Example Workflow:**
1. Developer pushes code to GitHub.  
2. GitHub Actions automatically runs tests.  
3. If tests pass, the app is built using Docker.  
4. The container is deployed to the production server automatically.
