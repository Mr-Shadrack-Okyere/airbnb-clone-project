### 🧠 Importance of Identifying Design Properties
Understanding design properties in Figma (like color, font, and spacing) ensures that:
- Your web app looks **consistent** across all pages.  
- It helps frontend developers follow the same **design system**.  
- It makes collaboration between designers and developers easier.  
- You can create **reusable components** that match the mockup perfectly.

### 💡 Why Component Patterns Matter
Planning reusable UI components ensures:
- Consistent design across the whole website  
- Faster development  
- Easier maintenance and scalability  
- Better team collaboration between designers and developers

- ## Team Roles

This project follows a typical team structure for building a scalable backend for an Airbnb-like application. Below are the primary roles and their responsibilities.

### Backend Developer
- Implement REST and/or GraphQL API endpoints for users, properties, bookings, payments, and reviews.
- Design and implement business logic, input validation, and error handling.
- Integrate with authentication systems and third-party services (e.g., payment gateways).
- Write unit and integration tests for backend components.

### Database Administrator (DBA)
- Design relational database schemas (tables, relationships, indexes) to support users, properties, bookings, payments, and reviews.
- Implement and tune indexes, queries, and migrations for performance and reliability.
- Manage backups, migrations, and optimization strategies (e.g., partitioning, query optimization).
- Coordinate with DevOps on replication, scaling, and backup/restore processes.

### DevOps Engineer
- Create containerized environments (Docker) and orchestration (if needed) for consistent deployments.
- Implement CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions) for automated testing and deployment.
- Monitor application health, set up logging and alerts, and ensure high availability.
- Manage infrastructure-as-code, environment variables, and secrets management.

### QA Engineer
- Define test plans and write automated test suites (unit, integration, end-to-end).
- Execute manual and automated test cases to verify API behavior, edge cases, and regressions.
- Report bugs, verify fixes, and ensure quality before deployments.
- Validate security requirements and API behavior under load where applicable.

### Product Owner
- Define and prioritize features and acceptance criteria based on user needs and business goals.
- Maintain the product backlog and accept or reject completed work based on acceptance criteria.
- Communicate with stakeholders and the development team to ensure alignment.

### Project Manager
- Plan sprints, coordinate team members, and track deadlines and deliverables.
- Facilitate meetings (standups, sprint planning, retrospectives) and remove blockers.
- Ensure proper documentation and timely project deliveries.

### Security Engineer (or Security-focused Developer role)
- Define and implement API security best practices (authentication, authorization, encryption).
- Perform security reviews, threat modelling, and remediation of vulnerabilities.
- Oversee sensitive data handling (PII, payment information) and compliance requirements.

### UI/UX Designer (if applicable)
- Create wireframes and UI mockups (Figma) for the user flows.
- Define the visual system: color palette, typography, and spacing tokens.
- Provide assets and design guidelines to frontend and backend teams for consistent UX.

> **Collaboration note:** Clear role definition improves accountability and speeds up development. In small teams a single person may perform multiple roles (e.g., Backend Developer + DevOps); document who handles what in your project README or team board.
